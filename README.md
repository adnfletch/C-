# C-
The includes some C# projects that I have created. They were developed as a windows form application to run in Visual Studios 2019.
The two dice pig project was a game that I coded on a windows form app. The instructions to play the game are on that form app when opened and ran in visual studios
but can also be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sJ38_XOnZzJ-tvjQmZeuM26vwI7P-_gDZLX36qiC9ZM/edit . 

The fractal project was a recursion based project where I used a picture box application to generate a fractal. I did this with various fractal designs and have included
one of them. 

To view the code specifically for the form app, navigate to the Form1.cs file.
